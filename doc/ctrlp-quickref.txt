INTRO                                                  *ctrlp-quickref-intro*

This plug-in is an extension of CtrlP and provides quick access to any
references in your local environment. Install this plug-in and register some
paths in specified variable or file, then you can open any files on the fly.

This plug-in also detect extensions of files and when opening files with
specified extensions like html or pdf, they are opened by "open-command"
which is "open" in Mac OS, "xdg-open" in Linux OS, "start" in Windows OS or
"cygstart" in Cygwin environment.

===============================================================================
USAGE                                                  *ctrlp-quickref-usage*

After installing this plug-in, you should register some paths you want to
search in g:ctrlp_quickref_paths variable or ~/.ctrlp-quickref file. If you
want to register paths in the variable, you should write them like below in
your vimrc.

    let g:ctrlp_quickref_paths = [
        \ '/directory1/library_or_something_else/src',
        \ '/directory2/*/src',
        \ '/directory3/*',
        " You want to exclude specified directory, put '!' at the head.
        \ '! /directory3/library_or_something_else/'
    ]

Wildcards are automatically expanded.
If you want to write paths in other file, you should make ~/.ctrlp-quickref
file and write them like below in it.

    # Write
    # Some
    # Comments
    /directory1/library_or_something_else/src
    /directory2/*/src

    # Additional comment
    /directory3/*

    # You can also exclude specified directory by writing like this
    ! /directory3/library_or_something_else

That's all you should do. As you can see, you can write paths like doing in
gitignore or something like that.

Then you run the command :CtrlPQuickRef and get CtrlP interface with paths
which are registered by you. After you choose one of them by typing some
characters and hit Enter, you get CtrlP interface again with files in selected
path. If you selected one or more of these files, they are opened in Vim. They
are opened with readonly flag by default.  Doing like this, you can open any
files on the fly.
